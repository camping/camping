= 2.1
=== 19th Aug, 2010 (whyday)
* Helpers#R now calls to_param on any object it passes in
* Fix route generation issue with routes including "." (#22)
* Improved tests
* Improved 1.9 support
* Camping::Server is now built upon Rack::Server
* Add support for ERB, Haml etc through Tilt
* Introducing Camping.options and Camping#set
* Camping::Server only loads ActiveRecord when needed

= 2.0
=== 9th Apr, 2010
* Speed-up of Camping::Mab (thanks zimbatm!)
* @state is now an alias of @env['rack.session']
* Camping.use injects a Rack middleware.
* Update Flipbook to RDoc 2.4
* Removed old examples. 
* Updated examples/blog.rb
* Camping::Apps returns!
* Session-cookies now timeout naturally (thanks jenna!)
* You can now `throw :halt` to halt the response in a helper.
* Camping::H#u is gone (was an alias to merge!)
* Camping::Session now uses session-cookies. The AR-backend is gone for now.
* camping/db.rb has been renamed to camping/ar.rb.
* Camping now uses Rack internally. Every app responds to #call.

= 1.6
=== Never released

* Camping::Apps removed, it wasn't reliable.
* bin/camping server kinds splitted in various files.
* NotFound and ServerError controllers changed to methods :

  r404 : called when a controller was not found
  r500 : called on uncaught exception
  r501 : called on undefined method
  
  All of those can be overridden at your taste.

* Markaby no longer required. Like AR, is it autoloaded on (Mab) usage.
* Camping::H is now inheriting from Hash instead of HashWithIndifferentAccess.
* Which made possible to remove the last strict dependency : active_support
* #errors_for removed, it wasn't really used
* Bug fixes !

= 1.5
=== 3rd Oct, 2006

* Camping::Apps stores an array of classes for all loaded apps. 
* bin/camping can be given a directory. Like: <tt>camping examples/</tt>
* Console mode -- thank zimbatm. Use: camping -C yourapp.rb 
* Call controllers with Camping.method_missing.

    Tepee.get(:Index) #=> (Response)
    Blog.post(:Delete, id) #=> (Response) 

    Blog.post(:Login, :input => {'username' => 'admin', 'password' => 'camping'}) 
      #=> #<Blog::Controllers::Login @user=... > 

    Blog.get(:Info, :env => {:HTTP_HOST => 'wagon'}) 
      #=> #<Blog::Controllers::Info @env={'HTTP_HOST'=>'wagon'} ...> 

* Using \r\n instead of \n on output. FastCGI has these needs. 
* ActiveRecord no longer required or installed. 
* If you refer to Models::Base, however, ActiveRecord will be loaded with autoload. (see lib/camping/db.rb) 
* new Camping::FastCGI.serve which will serve a whole directory of apps
  (see http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/wiki/TheCampingServer) 
* ~/.campingrc can contain database connection info if you want your default to be something other than SQLite. 

    database: 
      adapter: mysql 
      username: camping 
      socket: /tmp/mysql.sock 
      password: NOFORESTFIRES 
      database: camping 

* controllers are now *ordered*. uses the inherited hook to keep track of all 
  classes created with R. those classes are scanned, in order, when a request is 
  made. any other controllers are handled first. so if you plan on overriding the 
  urls method, be sure to subclass from R(). 
* Console mode will load .irbrc in the working directory, if present. 
  (for example, in my ~/git/balloon directory, i have this in the .irbrc: 
  include Balloon::Models 
  when camping -C balloon.rb gets run, the models all get included in main.) 
* And, of course, many other bugfixes from myself and the loyal+kind zimbatm...
* Markaby updated to 0.5. (See its CHANGELOG.)

= 1.4.2
=== 18th May, 2006

* Efficient file uploads for multipart/form-data POSTs.
* Camping tool now uses Mongrel, if available.  If not, sticks with WEBrick.
* Multiple apps can be loaded with the camping tool, each mounted according to their file name.

= 1.4.1
=== 3rd May, 2006

* Streaming HTTP support.  If body is IO, will simply pass to the controller.  Mongrel, in particular, supports this nicely.

= 1.4
=== 11th April, 2006

* Moved Camping::Controllers::Base to Camping::Base.
* Moved Camping::Controllers::R to Camping::R.
* New session library (lib/camping/session.rb).
* WEBrick handler (lib/camping/webrick.rb) and Mongrel handler (lib/camping/mongrel.rb).
* Helpers#URL, builds a complete URL for a route.  Returns a URI object. This way relative links could just return self.URL.path.
* Base#initialize takes over some of Base#service's duties.
* ENV now available as @env in controllers and views.
* Beautiful multi-page docs without frames!

= 1.3
=== 28th January, 2006

* bin/camping: an application launcher.
* <tt>Camping.run(request, response)</tt> now changed to <tt>controller = Camping.run(request, env)</tt>
* This means outputting the response is the wrapper/server's job.  See bin/camping, you can do a controller.to_s at the least.
* <tt>Controllers::Base.env</tt> is the new thread-safe home for <tt>ENV</tt>.
* The input hash now works more like Rails params.  You can call keys
  like methods or with symbols or strings.
* Queries are now parsed more like PHP/Rails, in that you can denote
  structure with brackets: post[user]=_why;post[id]=2
* Auto-prefix table names, to help prevent name clash.
* Helpers.errors_for simple validation.
* Lots of empty :href and :action attributes, a bug.
* New single-page flipbook RDoc template.

= 1.2
=== 23rd January, 2006

* Camping.goes allows fresh modules build from all Camping parts.
* File uploads now supported (multipart/form-data).
* Helpers.R can rebuild routes.
* Helpers./ for tracing paths from the root.

= 1.1
=== 19th January, 2006

* Allowed request and response streams to be passed in, to allow WEBrick and FastCGI support.

= 1.0
=== 17th January, 2006

* Initial checkin, see announcement at http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html.
