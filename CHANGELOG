=== 3rd Oct, 2006

* Camping::Apps stores an array of classes for all loaded apps.
* bin/camping can be given a directory. Like: <tt>camping examples/</tt>
* Console mode -- thank zimbatm. Use: camping -C yourapp.rb
* Call controllers with Camping.method_missing.

    Tepee.get(:Index) #=> (Response)
    Blog.post(:Delete, id) #=> (Response)

    Blog.post(:Login, :input => {'username' => 'admin', 'password' => 'camping'})
      #=> #<Blog::Controllers::Login @user=... >

    Blog.get(:Info, :env => {:HTTP_HOST => 'wagon'})
      #=> #<Blog::Controllers::Info @env={'HTTP_HOST'=>'wagon'} ...>

* Using \r\n instead of \n on output. FastCGI has these needs.
* ActiveRecord no longer required or installed.
* If you refer to Models::Base, however, ActiveRecord will be loaded with autoload. (see lib/camping/db.rb)
* new Camping::FastCGI.serve which will serve a whole directory of apps
  (see http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/wiki/TheCampingServer)
* ~/.campingrc can contain database connection info if you want your default to be something other than SQLite.

    database:
      adapter: mysql
      username: camping
      socket: /tmp/mysql.sock
      password: NOFORESTFIRES
      database: camping

* controllers are now *ordered*. uses the inherited hook to keep track of all
  classes created with R. those classes are scanned, in order, when a request is
  made. any other controllers are handled first. so if you plan on overriding the
  urls method, be sure to subclass from R().
* Console mode will load .irbrc in the working directory, if present.
  (for example, in my ~/git/balloon directory, i have this in the .irbrc:
  include Balloon::Models
  when camping -C balloon.rb gets run, the models all get included in main.)
* And, of course, many other bugfixes from myself and the loyal+kind zimbatm...
* Markaby updated to 0.5. (See its CHANGELOG.)

= 1.4.2
=== 18th May, 2006

* New session library (lib/camping/session.rb).

* Base#initialize takes over some of Base#service's duties.
* ENV now available as @env in controllers and views.
* Beautiful multi-page docs without frames!

= 1.3
=== 28th January, 2006

* bin/camping: an application launcher.
* <tt>Camping.run(request, response)</tt> now changed to <tt>controller = Camping.run(request, env)</tt>
* This means outputting the response is the wrapper/server's job.  See bin/camping, you can do a controller.to_s at the least.
* <tt>Controllers::Base.env</tt> is the new thread-safe home for <tt>ENV</tt>.
* The input hash now works more like Rails params.  You can call keys
  like methods or with symbols or strings.

  structure with brackets: post[user]=_why;post[id]=2
* Auto-prefix table names, to help prevent name clash.
* Helpers.errors_for simple validation.
