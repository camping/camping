# == About camping.rb
#
# Camping comes with two versions of its source code.  The code contained in
# lib/camping.rb is compressed, stripped of whitespace, using compact algorithms
# to keep it tight.  The unspoken rule is that camping.rb should be flowed with
# no more than 80 characters per line and must not exceed four kilobytes.
#
# On the other hand, lib/camping-unabridged.rb contains the same code, laid out
# nicely with piles of documentation everywhere. This documentation is entirely
# generated from lib/camping-unabridged.rb using RDoc and our "flipbook" template
# found in the extras directory of any camping distribution.

# If you're new to Camping, you should probably start by reading the first
# chapters of {The Camping Book}[file:book/01_introduction.html#toc].
# 
# Okay. So, the important thing to remember is that <tt>Camping.goes :Nuts</tt>
# copies the Camping module into Nuts. This means that you should never use
# any of these methods/classes on the Camping module, but rather on your own
# app. Here's a short explanation on how Camping is organized:
#
# * Camping::Controllers is where your controllers live.
# * Camping::Models is where your models live.
# * Camping::Views is where your views live.
# * Camping::Base is a module which is included in all your controllers.
# * Camping::Helpers is a module with useful helpers, both for the controllers
#   and the views. You should fill this up with your own helpers.
#
# Camping also ships with:
#
# * Camping::Session adds states to your app. 
# * Camping::Server starts up your app in development.
# * Camping::Reloader automatically reloads your apps when a file has changed.
# 
# More importantly, Camping also installs The Camping Server,
# please see Camping::Server.

  Apps = []
  # An object-like Hash.
  # All Camping query string and cookie variables are loaded as this.
  # 
  # To access the query string, for instance, use the <tt>@input</tt> variable.
  #
  #   module Blog::Controllers
  #     class Index < R '/'
  #       def get
  #         if (page = @input.page.to_i) > 0
  #           page -= 1
  #         end
  #         @posts = Post.all, :offset => page * 20, :limit => 20
  #         render :index
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # In the above example if you visit <tt>/?page=2</tt>, you'll get the second
  # page of twenty posts.  You can also use <tt>@input['page']</tt> to get the
  # value for the <tt>page</tt> query variable.
  class H < Hash
    # Gets or sets keys in the hash.

  # Helpers contains methods available in your controllers and views. You may
  # add methods of your own to this module, including many helper methods from
  # Rails. This is analogous to Rails' <tt>ApplicationHelper</tt> module.
  #
  # == Using ActionPack Helpers
  #
  # If you'd like to include helpers from Rails' modules, you'll need to look
  # up the helper module in the Rails documentation at http://api.rubyonrails.org/.
  #
  # For example, if you look up the <tt>ActionView::Helpers::FormTagHelper</tt>
  # class, you'll find that it's loaded from the <tt>action_view/helpers/form_tag_helper.rb</tt>
  # file. You'll need to have the ActionPack gem installed for this to work.
  #
  # Often the helpers depends on other helpers, so you would have to look up
  # the dependencies too. <tt>FormTagHelper</tt> for instance required the
  # <tt>content_tag</tt> provided by <tt>TagHelper</tt>. 
  #
  #   require 'action_view/helpers/form_tag_helper'
  #
  #   module Nuts::Helpers
  #     include ActionView::Helpers::TagHelper
  #     include ActionView::Helpers::FormTagHelper
  #   end
  #
  # == Return a response immediately
  # If you need to return a response inside a helper, you can use <tt>throw :halt</tt>. 
  #
  #   module Nuts::Helpers
  #     def requires_login!
  #       unless @state.user_id
  #         redirect Login
  #         throw :halt
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #   
  #   module Nuts::Controllers
  #     class Admin
  #       def get
  #         requires_login!
  #         "Never gets here unless you're logged in"
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  module Helpers
    # From inside your controllers and views, you will often need to figure out
    # the route used to get to a certain controller +c+. Pass the controller
    # class and any arguments into the R method, a string containing the route
    # will be returned to you.
    #
    # Assuming you have a specific route in an edit controller:
    #
    #   class Edit < R '/edit/(\d+)'
    #
    # A specific route to the Edit controller can be built with:
    #
    #   R(Edit, 1)
    #
    # Which outputs: <tt>/edit/1</tt>.
    #
    # If a controller has many routes, the route will be selected if it is the
    # first in the routing list to have the right number of arguments.
    #
    # == Using R in the View
    #
    # Keep in mind that this route doesn't include the root path. You will
    # need to use <tt>/</tt> (the slash method above) in your controllers.
    # Or, go ahead and use the Helpers#URL method to build a complete URL for
    # a route.
    #
    # However, in your views, the :href, :src and :action attributes
    # automatically pass through the slash method, so you are encouraged to
    # use <tt>R</tt> or <tt>URL</tt> in your views.
    #
    #  module Nuts::Views
    #    def menu
    #      div.menu! do
    #        a 'Home', :href => URL()
    #        a 'Profile', :href => "/profile"
    #        a 'Logout', :href => R(Logout)
    #        a 'Google', :href => 'http://google.com'
    #      end
    #    end
    #  end
    #
    # Let's say the above example takes place inside an application mounted at
    # <tt>http://localhost:3301/frodo</tt> and that a controller named
    # <tt>Logout</tt> is assigned to route <tt>/logout</tt>.
    # The HTML will come out as:
    #
    #   <div id="menu">
    #     <a href="http://localhost:3301/frodo/">Home</a>
    #     <a href="/frodo/profile">Profile</a>
    #     <a href="/frodo/logout">Logout</a>
    #     <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>
    #   </div>
    #
    def R(c,*g)
      p,h=/\(.+?\)/,g.grep(Hash)
      g-=h
      raise "bad route" if !u = c.urls.find{|x|
        break x if x.scan(p).size == g.size && 
          /^#{x}\/?$/ =~ (x=g.inject(x){|x,a|
            x.sub p,U.escape((a.to_param rescue a))}.gsub(/\\(.)/){$1})
      }
      h.any?? u+"?"+U.build_query(h[0]) : u
    end

    # Simply builds a complete path from a path +p+ within the app.  If your
    # application is mounted at <tt>/blog</tt>:
    #
    #   self / "/view/1"    #=> "/blog/view/1"
    #   self / "styles.css" #=> "styles.css"
    #   self / R(Edit, 1)   #=> "/blog/edit/1"
    #
    def /(p); p[0] == ?/ ? @root + p : p end
    
    # Builds a URL route to a controller or a path, returning a URI object.
    # This way you'll get the hostname and the port number, a complete URL.
    #
    # You can use this to grab URLs for controllers using the R-style syntax.
    # So, if your application is mounted at <tt>http://test.ing/blog/</tt>
    # and you have a View controller which routes as <tt>R '/view/(\d+)'</tt>:
    #
    #   URL(View, @post.id)    #=> #<URL:http://test.ing/blog/view/12>
    #
    # Or you can use the direct path:
    #
    #   self.URL               #=> #<URL:http://test.ing/blog/>
    #   self.URL + "view/12"   #=> #<URL:http://test.ing/blog/view/12>
    #   URL("/view/12")        #=> #<URL:http://test.ing/blog/view/12>
    #
    # It's okay to pass URL strings through this method as well:
    #
    #   URL("http://google.com")  #=> #<URL:http://google.com>
    #
    # Any string which doesn't begin with a slash will pass through
    # unscathed.
    def URL c='/',*a
      c = R(c, *a) if c.respond_to? :urls
      c = self/c
      c = @request.url[/.{8,}?(?=\/|$)/]+c if c[0]==?/
      URI(c)
    end
  end

  # Camping::Base is built into each controller by way of the generic routing

  # Controllers receive the requests and sends a response back to the client.
  # A controller is simply a class which must implement the HTTP methods it
  # wants to accept:
  #
  #   module Nuts::Controllers
  #     class Index
  #       def get
  #         "Hello World"
  #       end

  #         Post.create(@input) 
  #         redirect Index
  #       end
  #     end  
  #   end
  # 
  # == Defining a controller
  # 
  # There are two ways to define controllers: Just defining a class and let
  # Camping figure out the route, or add the route explicitly using R.
  # 
  # If you don't use R, Camping will first split the controller name up by
  # words (HelloWorld => Hello and World). Then it would do the following:
  # 
  # * Replace Index with /
  # * Replace X with ([^/]+)
  # * Replace N with (\\\d+)
  # * Everything else turns into lowercase
  # * Join the words with slashes
  #
  #--
  # NB!  N will actually be replaced with (\d+), but it needs to be escaped
  # here in order to work correctly with RDoc.
  #++
  #
  # Here's a few examples:
  # 
  #   Index   # => /
  #   PostN   # => /post/(\d+)
  #   PageX   # => /page/([^/]+)
  #   Pages   # => /pages
  # 
  # == The request
  # 
  # You have these variables which describes the request:
  # 
  # * @env contains the environment as defined in http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/SPEC.html
  # * @request is Rack::Request.new(@env)
  # * @root is the path where the app is mounted
  # * @cookies is a hash with the cookies sent by the client
  # * @state is a hash with the sessions (see Camping::Session)
  # * @method is the HTTP method in lowercase
  #
  # == The response
  #
  # You can change these variables to your needs:
  # 
  # * @status is the HTTP status (defaults to 200)
  # * @headers is a hash with the headers
  # * @body is the body (a string or something which responds to #each)
  # * Any changes in @cookies and @state will also be sent to the client
  #
  # If you haven't set @body, it will use the return value of the method:
  #
  #   module Nuts::Controllers
  #     class Index
  #       def get
  #         "This is the body"
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     class Posts
  #       def get
  #         @body = "Hello World!"
  #         "This is ignored"
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end

    @r = []
    class << self
      # Add routes to a controller class by piling them into the R method.

      #
      # * Classes without routes, since they refer to a very specific URL.

      # track of class creation order, we're keeping an internal list of the
      # controllers which inherit from R(). This method goes through and adds
      # all the remaining routes to the beginning of the list and ensures all
      # the controllers have the right mixins.
      #
      # Anyway, if you are calling the URI dispatcher from outside of a
      # Camping server, you'll definitely need to call this to set things up.
      # Don't call it too early though. Any controllers added after this
      # method is called won't work properly

  # Views is an empty module for storing methods which create HTML. The HTML
  # is described using the Markaby language.
  #
  # == Defining and calling templates
  #
  # Templates are simply Ruby methods with Markaby inside:
  #
  #   module Blog::Views
  #     def index
  #       p "Welcome to my blog"
  #     end
  #   
  #     def show
  #       h1 @post.title
  #       self << @post.content
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # In your controllers you just call <tt>render :template_name</tt> which will
  # invoke the template. The views and controllers will share instance
  # variables (as you can see above).
  #
  # == Using the layout method
  #
  # If your Views module has a <tt>layout</tt> method defined, it will be
  # called with a block which will insert content from your view:
  #
  #   module Blog::Views
  #     def layout
  #       html do
  #         head { title "My Blog "}
  #         body { self << yield }
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  module Views; include X, Helpers end
  
  # Models is an empty Ruby module for housing model classes derived
  # from ActiveRecord::Base. As a shortcut, you may derive from Base
  # which is an alias for ActiveRecord::Base.
  #
  #   module Camping::Models
  #     class Post < Base; belongs_to :user end
  #     class User < Base; has_many :posts end
  #   end
  #
  # == Where Models are Used
  #
  # Models are used in your controller classes. However, if your model class
  # name conflicts with a controller class name, you will need to refer to it
  # using the Models module.
  #
  #   module Camping::Controllers
  #     class Post < R '/post/(\d+)'
  #       def get(post_id)
  #         @post = Models::Post.find post_id
  #         render :index
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Models cannot be referred to in Views at this time.
