# Introduction

Camping is a small, micro web framework, less than 5k, a little white blood cell in
the vein of Ruby. This little book will start with a tutorial which takes
about fifteen minutes - by the end you should have a little Camping site up.
The following chapters will eventually go deeper into how Camping, HTTP and
Rack work.

("Eventually", because these chapters are not written yet. This book is
currently a very much work in progress, and we'll be very grateful if you want
to help out.)

If you at any moment need some help or have any questions or comments, we
highly recommend [opening an issue](https://github.com/camping/camping/issues/new) to ask for help. We've got plenty of nice people willing to help. We also have a Discord channel
at [rubypunks](https://discord.gg/JSmPBsWgFt)
if you're into that sort of thing.

Enough talk. Ready? Let's ["get started"](02_getting_started.md).
