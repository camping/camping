= Introduction

Camping is a small web framework, less than 4k, a little white blood cell in
the vein of Rails. This little book will start with a tutorial which takes
about fifteen minutes - by the end you should have a little Camping site up.
The following chapters will eventually go deeper into how both Camping, HTTP
and Rack works.

("Eventually", because these chapters are not written yet. This book is
currently a very much work in progress, and we'll be very grateful if you want
to help out.)

If you at any moment need some help or have any questions or comments, we
highly recommend {the mailing list}[http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/camping-list]
which got plenty of nice people willing to help. We also have an IRC-channel
at {#camping @ irc.freenode.net}[http://java.freenode.net/?channel=camping]
if you're into that sort of things.

Enough talk. Ready? Let's {"get started"}[link:book/02_getting_started.html].
